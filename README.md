# Rust Data Engineering
Four modules:
1. Rust development ecosystem, and data sructures: Collections.
2. Rust safety, security and concurrency.
3. Rust data engineering libraries and tools.
4. Designing data processessing systems in Rust.

## Learning Objectives
### Module 1 - Rust development ecosystem, and data sructures: Collections
- Utilize AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot to boost Rust productivity
- Set up continuous integration with Rust and GitHub Actions
- Launch cloud-based Rust development environments with GitHub Codespace

### Module 2 - Rust safety, security and concurrency
- Implement multi-factor authentication and encryption techniques in Rust
- Segment networks and restrict access between zones to improve security
- Write concurrent Rust code using threads and synchronization primitives
- Build chatbots and GPU-enabled tools by leveraging Rust's speed and efficiency
- Analyze performance of Rust vs. Python for metrics like energy use

### Module 3 - Rust data engineering libraries and tools
- Read and write CSV, Parquet files with Rust
- Scrape websites and handle APIs asynchronously
- Use data manipulation libraries like Polars, Arrow
- Pass messages for distributed data systems
- Interact with web services via REST, gRPC

### Module 4 - Designing data processessing systems in Rust
- Learn LLMOps interfaces to Rust
- Map data pipeline concepts using real-world analogies
- Evaluate open source data engineering tools
- Break down key parts of a pipeline - ingestion, processing, storage
- Build AWS Step Functions workflows with Rust
- Create async S3 Lambdas for cloud data tasks
- Explain and use “distroless” containers
