/*
* The dining philosophers problem involves multiple threads needing
* synchronised access to shared resources, risking deadlock.
*
* This code models philosophers as threads and forks as shared Mutex<()>
* wrapped in Arc for thread-safe reference counting.
*
* To prevent deadlock from a "deadly embrace" of waiting for neighboring
* forks, philosophers acquire lower numbered forks first. This breaks
* symmetry and avoids circular waiting.
*
* The Mutexes provide exclusive fork access. The Arc allows sharing forks
* between philosophers.
*
* The simulation prints start time, eating duration, and total time for
* all philosophers. Total time approximately equals philosophers divided
* by forks, as that number can eat concurrently.
*
* Key techniques:
* - Used Mutex<()> to represent exclusive fork access
* - Wrapped in Arc to share Mutexes between threads
* - Numbered philosophers and acquire lower fork first
* - Prints timing metrics for simulation

/*
Throughout this process, Mutex and Arc work together to provide safe concurrent access to
shared resources:

Arc allows multiple threads to have ownership of the same data (forks in this case).
Mutex ensures that only one thread can access a fork at a time.
When a philosopher tries to pick up a fork, they attempt to lock the Mutex.
If the lock is acquired, they have exclusive access to the fork.
If not, they wait until the fork becomes available.
This prevents data races and ensures that no two philosophers can use the same fork
simultaneously.

The use of Arc allows the forks to be shared between threads without knowing in advance
how long they need to live or which thread will be the last to use them. When all Arc
pointers to a fork are dropped (i.e., when the program ends), the fork is automatically
deallocated.
