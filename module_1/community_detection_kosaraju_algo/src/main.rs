/* Community detection within social networks using Twitter/X data.
Utilising Kosaraju's algorithm to detect Strongly Connected Components (SCCs).
Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm is a two-pass depth-first search (DFS) approach to find SCCs
in a directed graph. An SCC is a maximal subset of a graph where every node is
reachable from every other node in that subset.
